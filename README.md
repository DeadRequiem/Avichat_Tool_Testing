Avichat extension that hopefully works across any browser to add a slider for brightness control.

Does it work for all browsers? WHO KNOW! Only tested with Opera/GX. 
Chrome/Edge/Opera should all use the same webextension api and the only one that had to be specifically accounted for is firefox

How to install:
1. Download as zip
2. Create a folder somewhere that it won't get lost or accidentally deleted
3. Extract zip files into newely created folder
4. nav to ://extensions
5. Ensure 'Developer Mode' is enabled
6. Load Unpacked

Now when you next join Avichat you will have an extension config option ( the puzzle piece at the top of your browser, usually 
Slider goes from 0-100 and works by making use of Phasers setTint and altering the tilemap. 

I make no promises that this will work for everyone or at all, it is a proof of concept and I am very tired (✿◡‿◡) - Azrune
